To modify the game files in Atomic Tanks to increase the amount of money you can get, you need to edit the configuration or data files where the game stores the initial settings and values. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Locate the Game Files:**
   The game files for Atomic Tanks are typically located in the `/usr/share/games/atanks/` directory or similar. You'll need to have root privileges to modify these files.

2. **Open Terminal:**
   Open your terminal application.

3. **Navigate to the Game Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /usr/share/games/atanks/
   ```

4. **Find the Configuration File:**
   Look for a file that might store game settings, such as `config.cfg`, `settings.cfg`, or similar. You can list the files using:
   ```bash
   ls
   ```

5. **Edit the Configuration File:**
   Use a text editor to open the configuration file. For example, if the file is named `config.cfg`, you can use `nano`:
   ```bash
   sudo nano config.cfg
   ```

6. **Modify the Money Settings:**
   Search for settings related to money, such as `initial_money`, `money_multiplier`, or similar. Adjust these values to your desired amount. For example:
   ```plaintext
   initial_money = 100000
   ```

7. **Save and Exit:**
   Save the changes and exit the text editor. In `nano`, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl+X`, then `Y` to confirm, and `Enter` to save.

8. **Restart the Game:**
   Launch Atomic Tanks to see if the changes have taken effect.

If you can't find the exact file or the setting within the configuration files, it's possible that the game data is stored in binary files or within the game's code. In such cases, you might need to:

1. **Explore Other Directories:**
   Check other directories where the game might store its settings, such as `~/.atanks/` for user-specific configurations.

2. **Decompile the Game Code:**
   If you're comfortable with programming, you could decompile the game's binary to locate and modify the relevant variables directly in the code. This is more complex and requires knowledge of programming and reverse engineering.

3. **Check Game Documentation:**
   Refer to the game's documentation or community forums for specific guidance on modifying game settings.

Remember to back up any files before making changes, so you can restore them if something goes wrong.
