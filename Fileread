Here's an updated version of the function that checks only the first 20 hexadecimal values in the range to see if any of them are multiples of 4:

```python
def is_hex_between_and_multiple_of_four(start_hex, end_hex):
    # Convert the hexadecimal strings to integers
    start_value = int(start_hex, 16)
    end_value = int(end_hex, 16)
    
    # Check if the range is valid
    if start_value > end_value:
        print("Invalid range: start value should be less than or equal to end value.")
        return None
    
    # Iterate through the first 20 values in the range
    for i in range(min(20, end_value - start_value + 1)):
        value = start_value + i
        
        # Get the last two hexadecimal digits
        last_two_digits = value & 0xFF
        
        # Check if the last two digits are divisible by 4
        if last_two_digits % 4 == 0:
            # Convert the integer back to hexadecimal
            hex_value = hex(value)
            print(f"{hex_value} is a multiple of 4 between {start_hex} and {end_hex}.")
            return hex_value
    
    print(f"No hexadecimal value in the first 20 values between {start_hex} and {end_hex} is a multiple of 4.")
    return None

# Example usage
result = is_hex_between_and_multiple_of_four("0x04dc0d39", "0x04dc0d5b")
print(result)

result = is_hex_between_and_multiple_of_four("0xDEADBEEC", "0xDEADBEEF")
print(result)
```

Here's what has changed in the updated function:

1. Instead of iterating through the entire range of values between `start_value` and `end_value`, the loop now iterates only through the first 20 values using `range(min(20, end_value - start_value + 1))`.
2. The loop variable `i` is used to calculate the current value as `value = start_value + i`.
3. The rest of the logic remains the same: it checks if the last two digits of the current value are divisible by 4, and if so, it prints and returns the corresponding hexadecimal value.
4. If no value in the first 20 values is a multiple of 4, it prints a message indicating that no value was found and returns `None`.

The example usage at the end remains the same, demonstrating the function with two different ranges:
- `"0x04dc0d39"` to `"0x04dc0d5b"` (where `0x04dc0d3c` is a multiple of 4 in this range)
- `"0xDEADBEEC"` to `"0xDEADBEEF"` (where there are no multiples of 4 in the first 20 values of this range)

Note that if the range between `start_value` and `end_value` is less than 20, the function will check the entire range.
