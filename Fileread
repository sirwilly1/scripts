Here's an example of a `readonly://` region in an INI file that wouldn't exist on a real device, populated with a magic value. Then, there's a C payload that checks for that magic value and prints "matched" if it matches correctly.

**INI File**

```
[readonly://magic_region]
magic_value=0xDEADBEEF
```

**C Payload**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <inttypes.h>

int main() {
    uint32_t magic_value = 0xDEADBEEF;
    
    // Assuming the magic_value is read from some configuration file or device
    uint32_t read_magic_value = 0xDEADBEEF; // 0xDEADBEEF is just an example

    if (read_magic_value == magic_value) {
        printf("matched\n");
    } else {
        printf("not matched\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the INI file has a `readonly://` region named `magic_region`, which contains a `magic_value` set to `0xDEADBEEF`. This is a value that would not exist on a real device, as it is a commonly used "magic" value for debugging purposes.

The C payload defines a `magic_value` variable with the same value (`0xDEADBEEF`). It then assumes that the `read_magic_value` is read from some configuration file or device and sets it to the same value (`0xDEADBEEF`) for demonstration purposes.

The payload compares the `read_magic_value` with the `magic_value`. If they match, it prints "matched"; otherwise, it prints "not matched".

Note that in a real scenario, the `read_magic_value` would be obtained from the actual device or configuration file, rather than being hard-coded.
