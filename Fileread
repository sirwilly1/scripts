Yes, you can check if a hexadecimal value is a multiple of 4 without using a predefined list of divisible-by-four values. Here's an alternative approach:

```python
def is_hex_multiple_of_four(hex_value):
    # Convert the hexadecimal string to an integer
    value = int(hex_value, 16)
    
    # Get the last two hexadecimal digits
    last_two_digits = value & 0xFF  # Bitwise AND to get the last two digits
    
    # Check if the last two digits are divisible by 4
    if last_two_digits % 4 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Example usage
hex_value = "0xDEADBEEC"
if is_hex_multiple_of_four(hex_value):
    print(f"{hex_value} is a multiple of 4.")
else:
    print(f"{hex_value} is not a multiple of 4.")

hex_value = "0xDEADBEEF"
if is_hex_multiple_of_four(hex_value):
    print(f"{hex_value} is a multiple of 4.")
else:
    print(f"{hex_value} is not a multiple of 4.")
```

Here's how this approach works:

1. The function takes a `hex_value` string as input.
2. It converts the hexadecimal string to an integer using `int(hex_value, 16)`.
3. It performs a bitwise AND operation `value & 0xFF` to get the last two digits of the hexadecimal value, treating them as a decimal number.
4. It checks if the last two digits (treated as a decimal number) are divisible by 4 using the modulo operator `last_two_digits % 4 == 0`.
5. If the last two digits are divisible by 4, it returns `True`, indicating that the hexadecimal value is a multiple of 4.
6. If the last two digits are not divisible by 4, it returns `False`, indicating that the hexadecimal value is not a multiple of 4.

This approach doesn't require a predefined list of divisible-by-four values; instead, it directly checks the divisibility of the last two digits by 4 using the modulo operator.

The example usage at the end demonstrates how to use the `is_hex_multiple_of_four` function with two different hexadecimal values: `0xDEADBEEC` (which is a multiple of 4) and `0xDEADBEEF` (which is not a multiple of 4).
