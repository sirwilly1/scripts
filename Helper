Certainly! Here's a simple Python script that takes the number of copies as input through the command line and creates copies of the specified files with new names:

```python
import os
import shutil
import sys

def copy_files(num_copies):
    # List of file paths to make copies of
    file_paths = [
        "home/script/src/test.txt",
        # Add more file paths as needed
    ]

    for path in file_paths:
        # Extract directory and filename from the path
        directory, filename = os.path.split(path)
        # Extract file name and extension
        base_name, extension = os.path.splitext(filename)

        for i in range(1, num_copies + 1):
            # Construct new file name with the corresponding number
            new_filename = f"{base_name}{i}{extension}"
            # Create the full path for the new file
            new_path = os.path.join(directory, new_filename)

            # Copy the file to the new path
            shutil.copy2(path, new_path)
            print(f"Copy created: {new_path}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Check if the correct number of command line arguments is provided
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("Usage: python script.py <num_copies>")
        sys.exit(1)

    # Get the number of copies from the command line
    num_copies = int(sys.argv[1])

    # Call the function to copy files
    copy_files(num_copies)
```

Save this script in a file (e.g., `copy_script.py`) and run it from the command line, providing the number of copies as an argument:

```bash
python copy_script.py 3
```

This example will create three copies of each specified file with names like `test1.txt`, `test2.txt`, and `test3.txt`. Adjust the `file_paths` list with the desired file paths.




import subprocess

def launch_terminator_with_panes():
    try:
        subprocess.run(['terminator', '--layout', '4'])
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Terminator not found. Make sure it's installed on your system.")

# Call the function to launch Terminator with four panes
launch_terminator_with_panes()
