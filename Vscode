To launch VSCode using the command "code ." in Debian, you need to make sure the `code` command is available in your system's PATH. If it's not already set up, you can do this by creating a symbolic link to the VSCode executable. Here's how:

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Navigate to the directory where VSCode is installed. This might be `/usr/share/code` or a similar location.
3. Create a symbolic link to the `code` executable using the following command:

```
sudo ln -s /usr/share/code/bin/code /usr/bin/code
```

This command creates a symbolic link named `code` in `/usr/bin` that points to the `code` executable in the VSCode installation directory.

Once you've done this, you should be able to launch VSCode from the terminal using the command `code .`.
