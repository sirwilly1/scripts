Nice — here’s a compact, practical catalogue of penetration-testing / auditing tools and suites for blockchain (mostly EVM / smart-contract focused, plus monitoring & forensics). I’ve grouped them by purpose so you can pick the right tool for the stage of testing you’re doing.

Static analysis & linting
	•	Slither — fast static analysis framework for Solidity (many checks, CI friendly).  ￼
	•	Securify / Securify2 — rule-based static analysis for common Solidity bugs.  ￼
	•	SmartCheck — code scanner that flags patterns and anti-patterns in Solidity.  ￼

Symbolic execution / bytecode analysis
	•	Mythril / MythX — symbolic execution engine + MythX is the SaaS; finds path-dependent bugs at the bytecode level. Good for deeper exploit discovery.  ￼
	•	Oyente — one of the early EVM analyzers (legacy but historically important).  ￼

Fuzzers & property-based testing
	•	Echidna (Crytic) — property-based fuzzer for Solidity (excellent for invariant testing).  ￼
	•	Manticore — execution-based analysis / symbolic execution and fuzzer by Trail of Bits ecosystem.  ￼
	•	Foundry / Forge fuzzer — modern EVM dev toolchain with a fast fuzzer integrated (popular for dev/test CI).  ￼
	•	Medusa — experimental/parallel smart-contract fuzzer inspired by Echidna.  ￼

End-to-end testing / dev tool plugins
	•	Hardhat (with security plugins) — dev framework with many plugins for security testing and running fuzzers / static tools in CI.  ￼
	•	Remix IDE — quick checks and manual testing + many analysis plugins/extensions.  ￼
	•	Truffle / Ganache — local chain + test harness used to run attack scenarios and tests.

Monitoring, runtime detection & alerting (on-chain / observability)
	•	Forta — real-time agent framework that monitors transactions and emits alerts (useful for continuous runtime detection).  ￼
	•	Tenderly — tx replay, debugging, and monitoring (useful for incident repro and simulation of exploits).  ￼

Commercial / audit platforms & services (suites)
	•	ConsenSys Diligence — collection of tools + services (Mythril, Diligence Fuzzing, guides) for audits and fuzzing-as-a-service.  ￼
	•	Trail of Bits / Crytic — consultancy + open tools (Slither, other research tools).  ￼
	•	CertiK, SlowMist, Beosin, Hacken — commercial monitoring, audit and security posture services (useful for post-deployment monitoring & threat intel).  ￼

Chain analysis & forensics (useful for post-exploit investigations)
	•	Chainalysis, Elliptic — on-chain analytics / tracing (useful for tracing stolen funds, exchange interaction).  ￼

Helpful complementary tools / libs
	•	Mythril CLI (open-source component) — run local scans on bytecode.  ￼
	•	Harvey / other emerging fuzzers — newer fuzzers appear frequently; ConsenSys benchmarks several to pick the right one.  ￼

Recommended quick workflows
	1.	Local dev checks: Slither + unit tests in Foundry/Hardhat + Echidna fuzz runs.  ￼
	2.	Deeper analysis: run Mythril/MythX (symbolic execution) and Manticore to exercise edge paths.  ￼
	3.	Pre-deploy / CI: integrate Slither + Forge/Foundry fuzz + automated MythX scans in CI.  ￼
	4.	Post-deploy monitoring: instrument FORTA agents + Tenderly for tx replay & quick repro.  ￼

Notes & pointers
	•	The ecosystem moves fast — new fuzzers, CI plugins, and commercial offerings appear frequently; if you want, I can fetch the most current comparison (benchmarks, GitHub activity, licensing) for a short list you care about (e.g., Slither vs. Slither+Echidna vs. Foundry).  ￼
	•	If you tell me which chain (Ethereum, BSC, Solana, Cosmos, Solana needs different toolsets) or which language (Solidity vs. Move vs. Rust), I’ll tailor the list and include chain-specific tools (for example, Solana / Rust uses different fuzzers and analyzers).

Want a tidy downloadable checklist (eg. a one-page bash/CI snippet that runs Slither → Echidna → Mythril) I can compose for you now?
