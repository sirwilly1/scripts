Testing packet redirection using `iperf` would involve measuring the bandwidth between the client and the server through the redirection server. You would need to set up `iperf` in server mode on Server C (the final receiving server) and in client mode on Server A (the initial sending server), with Server B acting as the redirection server running the redirection program.

Here's how to do it step-by-step:

1. **Set Up `iperf` Server (Server C):**
   - Install `iperf` on Server C.
   - Start `iperf` in server mode by running `iperf -s` for TCP or `iperf -s -u` for UDP.

2. **Set Up Redirection Server (Server B):**
   - Compile and run the packet redirection program on Server B.
   - Configure it to listen for TCP or UDP (depending on your test) packets on a specific port and redirect them to Server Câ€™s IP address and the `iperf` port.

3. **Set Up `iperf` Client (Server A):**
   - Install `iperf` on Server A.
   - Run `iperf` in client mode targeting Server B's IP address and the port where the redirection program is listening. Use `iperf -c <Server_B_IP> -p <Redirection_Program_Port>` for TCP or add the `-u` flag for UDP.

4. **Conduct the Test:**
   - Execute the `iperf` test from Server A.
   - Observe the output on Server A for client-side results and on Server C for server-side results.

Here's an example command to use `iperf` in UDP mode (since the packet redirection program supports both TCP and UDP, and `iperf` has options for both):

For UDP test:

```bash
iperf -c <Server_B_IP> -p <Redirection_Program_Port> -u
```

For TCP test:

```bash
iperf -c <Server_B_IP> -p <Redirection_Program_Port>
```

Replace `<Server_B_IP>` with the IP address of Server B and `<Redirection_Program_Port>` with the port where your redirection program is listening.

While the test is running, the redirection program should handle the incoming `iperf` traffic from Server A and redirect it to Server C, then take the responses from Server C and send them back to Server A. This will test the bandwidth through the redirection setup.

You would measure the success of the redirection by comparing the bandwidth results reported by `iperf` on Server A with the expected bandwidth to Server C when connected directly. If the redirection is working correctly, the `iperf` results should be similar, minus some overhead introduced by the redirection process.

During the test, you can also monitor the packet flow using network tools like `tcpdump` or `Wireshark` to ensure the traffic is being properly redirected.
