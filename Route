Yes, the routing setup you described could potentially cause retransmission issues if the configuration leads to improper packet routing or if there are network path issues. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Scenario Breakdown

1. **VM A** has the IP address `15.20.0.16`.
2. Both **VM A** and **VM B** have been configured with the route `15.15.10.0/24 via 15.20.0.16`.

### Potential Issues

1. **Routing Loop**: If VM A is the gateway for the `15.15.10.0/24` network, but `15.20.0.16` (VM A's own IP) is set as the next hop, this can create a routing loop, causing packets to be sent back to the sender and leading to retransmissions.

2. **Incorrect Gateway**: If `15.20.0.16` is not a proper gateway to the `15.15.10.0/24` network, packets will not reach their intended destination, leading to timeouts and retransmissions.

3. **Network Path Issues**: If the actual path between the source and destination has issues (e.g., high latency, packet loss, or network congestion), it can cause retransmissions.

4. **Firewall/Filtering Issues**: If there are firewall rules or network filtering devices that drop or modify packets, it can lead to retransmissions.

### Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Check Routing Tables**: Ensure that the routing table entries are correct and there are no loops. On both VMs, you can check the routing table with:
   ```sh
   ip route show
   ```

2. **Traceroute**: Use `traceroute` to see the path packets are taking and identify any loops or misroutes:
   ```sh
   traceroute 15.15.10.x
   ```

3. **Ping Test**: Test connectivity to see if packets are reaching the destination:
   ```sh
   ping 15.15.10.x
   ```

4. **Network Configuration**: Ensure that `15.20.0.16` (VM A) is configured correctly as a gateway. Check if it has forwarding enabled and the necessary routes to reach `15.15.10.0/24`.

5. **TCP Dump/Wireshark**: Capture traffic to see where packets are going and identify retransmissions and any anomalies:
   ```sh
   sudo tcpdump -i eth0 host 15.15.10.x
   ```

### Correct Routing Setup

Ensure that the routing makes sense for your network topology. If `15.15.10.0/24` is a network reachable through another gateway, configure the route correctly. For example, if another machine (say `15.20.0.1`) is the proper gateway, you should set:

```sh
sudo ip route add 15.15.10.0/24 via 15.20.0.1
```

### Example Correction

If `15.20.0.16` should not be the gateway, remove the incorrect route:

```sh
sudo ip route del 15.15.10.0/24 via 15.20.0.16
```

Then add the correct route:

```sh
sudo ip route add 15.15.10.0/24 via <correct-gateway-ip>




----------

If the `ip route del` command doesn't work, there might be a few reasons why it's not letting you delete the route. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and ensure the route is deleted:

### Check the Exact Route

First, confirm the exact route entry. The route might have additional parameters or different syntax. Use:

```sh
ip route show
```

Look for the specific route entry and note its exact details.

### Delete with Specific Parameters

Sometimes the route might have more specific parameters that need to be included when deleting. For example:

```sh
sudo ip route del 15.15.10.0/24 via 15.20.0.16 dev eth0
```

Replace `eth0` with the actual network interface if applicable.

### Delete by Network Only

If the specific parameters approach doesn't work, try deleting the route by network only:

```sh
sudo ip route del 15.15.10.0/24
```

### Check for Persistence

Ensure the route isn't being added by a startup script or a network configuration file. Check the following files for any route additions:

- `/etc/network/interfaces`
- `/etc/network/interfaces.d/*`
- Custom scripts in `/etc/init.d/` or `/etc/systemd/system/`

### Reboot

As a last resort, a reboot might clear any dynamically added routes that are not being removed by the commands.

If none of these steps work, please provide the exact error message or behavior you're encountering when attempting to delete the route.
```

By ensuring proper routing configuration, you can prevent retransmission issues and improve network performance.
