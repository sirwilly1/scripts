Certainly! Here are 10 examples of using `perf` to analyze various programs and tasks on Linux:

1. **Analyze a Process by PID:**
   ```bash
   perf record -o perf.data -p <PID>
   perf report -i perf.data
   ```

2. **Profile CPU Usage of a Command:**
   ```bash
   perf stat <your-command>
   ```

3. **Top Functions Consuming CPU Time:**
   ```bash
   perf top
   ```

4. **Record System-wide Events:**
   ```bash
   perf record -a -g -o perf.data sleep 10
   perf report -i perf.data
   ```

5. **Profile Specific Event:**
   ```bash
   perf record -e cpu-cycles -o perf.data <your-command>
   perf report -i perf.data
   ```

6. **Profile Kernel Function Calls:**
   ```bash
   perf record -e cycles:k -a
   perf report
   ```

7. **Monitor Context Switches:**
   ```bash
   perf record -e context-switches -a
   perf report
   ```

8. **Profile Memory Events:**
   ```bash
   perf record -e cache-misses -o perf.data <your-command>
   perf report -i perf.data
   ```

9. **Profile Disk I/O:**
   ```bash
   perf record -e block:block_rq_issue -a
   perf report
   ```

10. **Trace System Calls:**
    ```bash
    perf trace -e syscalls:sys_enter_<syscall_name> <your-command>
    ```

Remember to customize these examples based on your specific use case, and explore additional `perf` options to tailor your analysis. The key is to choose the right events and focus on the aspects of performance that matter to your investigation.





To monitor a program you wrote using `perf`, follow these steps:

1. **Compile with Debug Symbols:**
   Ensure your program is compiled with debug symbols to get meaningful function names in the analysis. Use the `-g` flag with your compiler (e.g., `gcc -g your_program.c -o your_program`).

2. **Run Your Program with perf:**
   Run your program with `perf` by specifying the `record` subcommand:
   ```bash
   perf record -o perf.data ./your_program
   ```

3. **Stop Recording:**
   After your program finishes running, stop the recording:
   ```bash
   perf report -i perf.data
   ```

4. **Analyze the Report:**
   The `perf report` command will display a summary of the performance profile, showing CPU usage, function call traces, and more.

5. **Customize Events (Optional):**
   You can customize the events you want to monitor. For example, to profile cache-misses, you can use:
   ```bash
   perf record -e cache-misses -o perf.data ./your_program
   ```

6. **Explore Other perf Commands:**
   Use other `perf` commands like `perf stat`, `perf top`, or `perf trace` to gather different types of performance information.

Here's a simple example with a C program:

```c
// your_program.c
#include <stdio.h>

void myFunction() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i) {
        // Your code here
    }
}

int main() {
    myFunction();
    return 0;
}
```

Compile and run it with perf:

```bash
gcc -g your_program.c -o your_program
perf record -o perf.data ./your_program
perf report -i perf.data
```

Remember to adapt these steps based on your program's characteristics and the specific aspects you want to monitor.
