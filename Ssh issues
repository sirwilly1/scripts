To SSH from your Windows machine through a Debian VM to an emulator running on a TAP interface, you'll need to set up port forwarding or use SSH tunneling. Hereâ€™s how you can achieve this:

### Network Setup

- **Windows IP**: 192.168.1.1
- **Debian VM IP**: 10.50.0.27
- **TAP IP on Debian VM**: 15.15.15.1
- **Emulator IP on TAP network**: Assume 15.15.15.2

### Steps to SSH from Windows to Emulator via Debian VM

#### 1. Set Up TAP Interface on Debian VM

Ensure the TAP interface is configured and up on your Debian VM:

```sh
sudo ip tuntap add dev tap0 mode tap
sudo ip addr add 15.15.15.1/24 dev tap0
sudo ip link set dev tap0 up
```

#### 2. Verify Connectivity

Ensure that your Debian VM can communicate with the emulator:

```sh
ping 15.15.15.2
```

#### 3. Set Up SSH on Debian VM

Ensure the SSH server is running on your Debian VM:

```sh
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
sudo systemctl start ssh
sudo systemctl enable ssh
```

#### 4. Create an SSH Tunnel from Windows to Emulator via Debian VM

You can create an SSH tunnel using PuTTY or the built-in OpenSSH client in Windows.

##### Using PuTTY:

1. **Open PuTTY**.
2. **Configure the connection to the Debian VM**:
   - In the "Host Name (or IP address)" field, enter `10.50.0.27`.
3. **Configure SSH Tunneling**:
   - In the PuTTY configuration window, go to `Connection > SSH > Tunnels`.
   - In the "Source port" field, enter `2222` (or any other available port on your Windows machine).
   - In the "Destination" field, enter `15.15.15.2:22`.
   - Click `Add`.
4. **Start the SSH session**:
   - Go back to the `Session` category and click `Open`.
   - Log in to your Debian VM.

##### Using OpenSSH Client in Windows:

Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell window and use the following command to create the tunnel:

```sh
ssh -L 2222:15.15.15.2:22 username@10.50.0.27
```

Replace `username` with your actual username on the Debian VM.

#### 5. SSH to the Emulator from Windows

After establishing the tunnel, open another Command Prompt or PowerShell window and SSH to the emulator through the tunnel:

```sh
ssh username@localhost -p 2222
```

Replace `username` with your actual username on the emulator.

### Summary of Commands and Configuration

1. **Configure TAP interface on Debian VM**:
   ```sh
   sudo ip tuntap add dev tap0 mode tap
   sudo ip addr add 15.15.15.1/24 dev tap0
   sudo ip link set dev tap0 up
   ```

2. **Ensure SSH server is running on Debian VM**:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install openssh-server
   sudo systemctl start ssh
   sudo systemctl enable ssh
   ```

3. **Create SSH tunnel**:
   - **Using PuTTY**: Configure tunnel with source port `2222` and destination `15.15.15.2:22`.
   - **Using OpenSSH client**:
     ```sh
     ssh -L 2222:15.15.15.2:22 username@10.50.0.27
     ```

4. **SSH to the emulator via the tunnel**:
   ```sh
   ssh username@localhost -p 2222
   ```

This setup allows you to securely SSH from your Windows machine to the emulator by tunneling through the Debian VM.
