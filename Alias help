In Linux, when you want to create an alias that includes special characters like single quotes, you need to be careful with the escaping of those characters. The command you provided:

```bash
(trap 'kill 0' SIGINT; prog1 & prog2 & prog3)
```

contains single quotes around `kill 0`, which need to be properly escaped when defining an alias. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Using Double Quotes for the Alias**: Since the command already contains single quotes, you can define the alias using double quotes.

2. **Escaping Single Quotes**: Inside the alias, escape the single quotes around `kill 0` with a backslash (`\`).

Here’s how you can define the alias:

```bash
alias myalias="(trap 'kill 0' SIGINT; prog1 & prog2 & prog3)"
```

Alternatively, you can escape the single quotes explicitly:

```bash
alias myalias="(trap \'kill 0\' SIGINT; prog1 & prog2 & prog3)"
```

**Steps to define the alias**:
1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the alias command as shown above.
3. After setting the alias, you can use `myalias` to execute your command.

If you want this alias to persist across terminal sessions, you can add the alias command to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file, depending on your shell, and then source the file with `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc`.

---------
To add the alias to your `~/.bashrc` file, follow these steps:

1. **Open the `~/.bashrc` file**:
   - You can use any text editor to open the file. For example, using `nano`:
     ```bash
     nano ~/.bashrc
     ```
   - Or, using `vim`:
     ```bash
     vim ~/.bashrc
     ```

2. **Add the alias**:
   - Scroll to the bottom of the file (or find a suitable place) and add your alias command. Here's how you would write it:
     ```bash
     alias myalias="(trap 'kill 0' SIGINT; prog1 & prog2 & prog3)"
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can use the escaped version:
     ```bash
     alias myalias="(trap \'kill 0\' SIGINT; prog1 & prog2 & prog3)"
     ```

3. **Save and exit**:
   - If you're using `nano`, press `CTRL + O` to write the changes, then `ENTER` to confirm, and `CTRL + X` to exit.
   - If you're using `vim`, press `ESC`, type `:wq`, and press `ENTER` to save and exit.

4. **Apply the changes**:
   - After saving the file, you'll need to reload your `~/.bashrc` to apply the changes. You can do this by running:
     ```bash
     source ~/.bashrc
     ```

Now, the alias `myalias` will be available whenever you open a new terminal session. You can use `myalias` to run your command with the trap and the background processes.
