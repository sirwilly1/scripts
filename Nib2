Yes, you can use a single command in the terminal to rename all `.txt` files to `.mib` in a directory. Here's the command:

```bash
for file in *.txt; do mv "$file" "${file%.txt}.mib"; done
```

### Explanation:

- `for file in *.txt`: This part of the command loops over all files with the `.txt` extension in the current directory.
- `mv "$file" "${file%.txt}.mib"`: This renames each file by stripping off the `.txt` extension (`${file%.txt}`) and appending `.mib`.
- `done`: Marks the end of the loop.

### How to Use:

1. Navigate to the directory where your `.txt` MIB files are located:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/mibs
   ```

2. Run the command:

   ```bash
   for file in *.txt; do mv "$file" "${file%.txt}.mib"; done
   ```

This command will rename all `.txt` files in the directory to `.mib` in one go, without needing a separate script.
