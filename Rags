That’s a great combo — Discord + LLaMA + RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a perfect setup for interactive, context-rich AI assistants or community tools. Here are several categories of projects you can build, from simple prototypes to full production systems:

⸻

🧠 1. Knowledge Assistant for Discord

Goal: Let your Discord bot answer questions using your own data (docs, PDFs, codebases, etc.).

How it works:
	•	Store data (Markdown, PDFs, wikis) in a vector database (like FAISS, Chroma, or Qdrant).
	•	Use embeddings (via sentence-transformers, InstructorXL, or LLaMA Embedding models).
	•	When a user asks something in Discord:
	1.	The bot retrieves the most relevant chunks.
	2.	Sends them to your LLaMA model (via Ollama or HuggingFace) with the user’s question.
	3.	Streams the answer back to Discord.

Example use cases:
	•	“Ask the Docs” bot for your startup or internal wiki.
	•	Northrop project reference assistant (summarize C code, YAML configs, meeting notes).
	•	Custom GPT-like Q&A for your trading Discord.

💬 2. Multi-User Memory Bot

Goal: Give your Discord community an AI “memory” that recalls past conversations.

How it works:
	•	Save message history embeddings to a vector DB.
	•	Use RAG to retrieve similar past topics when someone asks a question.
	•	Provide continuity: “Last time you mentioned the AI marketplace idea — here’s what you said…”

Tools:
	•	SQLite + Chroma for fast prototyping.
	•	RAG pipeline + conversational chain (LangChain or LlamaIndex).

📊 3. Trading/Finance RAG Bot

Goal: Build a bot that summarizes financial data or news for your Discord group.

Data Sources:
	•	Scraped or API-fed data (SEC filings, broker challenge stats, macro news, etc.).
	•	Store embeddings and metadata (date, ticker, sentiment).

Bot Actions:
	•	“/summarize NVDA earnings”
	•	“/compare last week’s CPI to June”
	•	“/rank brokers by CPA payout and volume”

Stack Example:
	•	Discord.py + Ollama (LLaMA 3 8B or 13B)
	•	Vector DB (FAISS or LanceDB)
	•	Optional: integrate with Yahoo Finance, FRED, or Polygon.io API.

🧩 4. RAG-Powered Agent Marketplace

Goal: Extend your multi-agent marketplace idea (AgentWorks) into Discord.

Features:
	•	Each agent (e.g., “ResearchAgent”, “CoderAgent”, “FinanceAgent”) has its own vector memory.
	•	Users can “hire” or “collaborate” with them via Discord commands.
	•	LLaMA acts as the reasoning layer; retrieval provides tool/context grounding.

Example Commands:

/agent hire ResearchAgent "Find top 3 DoD AI contracts"
/agent memory add "Northrop Q3 AI Initiative presentation"
/agent summarize

🕹️ 5. Code/Project Documentation Companion

Goal: Query your own GitHub repo or YAML-configured project files directly in Discord.

Use Case:
	•	“What does Build_t struct do?”
	•	“Where is the .pcparams section parsed?”

Stack:
	•	Embed repo contents with LlamaIndex or LangChain’s document loaders.
	•	Run local LLaMA 3 8B Instruct via Ollama for low-latency inference.
	•	Hook responses to /code, /doc, or /explain Discord commands.

🧰 Example Tech Stack (Minimal MVP)

stack:
  llm: "LLaMA 3 8B (via Ollama)"
  framework: "LangChain or LlamaIndex"
  vector_db: "Chroma"
  discord_api: "discord.py or nextcord"
  retrieval:
    embeddings: "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
    chunk_size: 512
  hosting:
    - local docker-compose
    - or lightweight EC2

If you tell me what direction you want — community bot, coding assistant, or trading assistant — I can generate a working Discord bot + RAG pipeline YAML + code skeleton that you can run with docker-compose up.

Would you like me to start with that? we
